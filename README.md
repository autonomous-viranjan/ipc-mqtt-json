# IPC via MQTT Protocol and json

## Basic example scripts
This repository contains examples of MQTT clients using the MQTT 5.0 protocol. A publisher-subscriber scheme is illustrated which can serve as a building block for more complex communication architectures. 

Key dependencies:
- Mosquitto MQTT broker
- Eclipse paho-mqtt library
- nlohmann json library

See [https://makesomeshit.com/] for a nice introductory tutorial.

To run:
* Compile C++ files `bash build`
* Run MQTT broker `mosquitto`
* Run publisher and subscriber files
